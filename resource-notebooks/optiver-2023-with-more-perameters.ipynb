    "2. `prices = ['reference_price', 'far_price', 'near_price', 'ask_price', 'bid_price', 'wap']`:\n",

    "\n",
    "3. `for i, a in enumerate(prices):`:\n",
    "   - This line starts a loop that iterates over the elements in the `prices` list, and it uses `i` to keep track of the index and `a` to store the name of the first price.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. `for j, b in enumerate(prices):`:\n",
    "   - Inside the previous loop, this line starts another loop that iterates over the same `prices` list. It uses `j` to keep track of the index and `b` to store the name of the second price.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. `if i > j:`:\n",
    "   - This line checks if the index of the first price (a) is greater than the index of the second price (b). This condition ensures that we only calculate features where the first price comes after the second price in the list.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. `df[f'{a}_{b}_imb'] = df.eval(f'({a} - {b}) / ({a} + {b})')`:\n",
    "   - If the condition in the previous line is met, this line calculates a new feature by subtracting the second price (b) from the first price (a) and then dividing the result by the sum of the two prices.\n",
    "   - The calculated feature is added as a new column in the DataFrame with a name in the format `{a}_{b}_imb`, where `a` and `b` are the names of the prices being compared.\n",
    "\n",
    "7. `features.append(f'{a}_{b}_imb')`:\n",

    "\n",

    "   - Finally, the function returns the modified DataFrame (`df`) with the added features and the updated list of features (`features`).\n",
